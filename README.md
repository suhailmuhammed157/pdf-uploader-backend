○ Tech stack used, including specific libraries / versions.

- tech - NodeJS
- framework - ExpressJS
- libraries - express-fileupload (for the file upload)

○ Project setup guidelines

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NodeJS if not installed
3. Run the command 'npm install' inside project path for installing dependencies
4. Run the command 'nodemon app.js' inside project to run the backend on port 3500

○ A quick paragraph with how you approached the project, what you liked,
what you didn’t like, and where you faced issues.

- I initially planned to not use a backend for the file uploader(front-end). But to make more practical and a real life scenario where a front-end is communicated with backend via APIs.
- I was not familiar with MongoDB and Mongoose, so I decided to store the uploaded files in a local directory.
- The way in which the APIs are constructed using middlewares for a proper structure and validations.
- The issues which I faced was mainly for the fileuploader package, which I was using for the first time. I have used Multer previously. Since it is just for a single file uplaod, I have tried fileupload package.

○ Estimated time to complete yourtest.

- Approcimately 4 hours was taken to completely finish the backend with testing.
